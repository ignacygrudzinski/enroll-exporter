# enroll-exporter
A simple tool made to export timetables from enroll-me.iiet.pl
Generates an .ics file from your timetable, ignoring week types, half-semester classes and holidyas.
Works **only with the original enroll-me**, not tested with enroll-me-2.

## Usage:
Change the repeatEndDate String to match the last day of classes of the semester, then
paste the code into web console on your enrollment view site.

## Disclaimer:
This tool is a bodge and will probably not be updated or supported. If it happens to break, feel free to fix it and take all the credit.
